PROJECT TITLE: rpgText-game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Mess around with code and get a feel for what it's like to develop game code
VERSION or DATE: 3.27.23
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Start with a character creator that allows a user to input values to create a character with a name, health, attack, defense and speed stats
AUTHORS: Anthony M. Lopez
USER INSTRUCTIONS: I'm pretty certain if using standard Java IDEs you would need a main file to exectute this program. For now I'm using the BlueJ IDE so I can run a main method from the ImprovedArena class. Don't expect any in depth gameplay, but do expect a decent amount of code and comments that log my experience writing the program.
